# Setting up Mac laptop

The goal of this writeup is to provide sensible defaults to get started with.
Once you have started using a particular tool you should customize the tool to
match your working style.


I have covered the most important app [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) at the very end because
that takes the maximum space. Before that let me go through some of the other items.

## Emoji app

[Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) is a free Mac app that lets you type emojis slack style.
Download the app. Install it. Open it.

Now open Apple notes. Type I `:hear` AI and you will see heart emoji pop up.
Now open google doc and do the same. Do the same in google sheet.

Point is once this app is installed then you can type emojis really fast Slack style. This is so good that
it should be the default feature of Mac and Apple should ship it out of the box.

## Menu Bar Calendar

Sometimes in the call I need to share a calendar to discuss dates.
Typically I open google calendar but it has information about my upcoming meetings
and appointments.

[Menu Bar Calendar](https://sindresorhus.com/menu-bar-calendar) is a free calendar app
which sits on the menu bar.

## Firwally

[Firewally](https://nektony.com/firewally) is a free Mac app that let's me see all the applications that are sending and receiving data from the Internet. With a click of a button I can cut off the network access of any application.

## Speediness

[Speediness](https://sindresorhus.com/speediness) is a free Mac app that tests my upload and download speed. Mostly I use it to check
if I have Internet access or not.
