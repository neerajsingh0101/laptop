# Setting up Mac laptop

The goal of this writeup is to provide others with a good default to start with.
That's it. A good place to start with sensible defaults. Once you get started
then you should make changes to suit your working style.

I have covered the most important app [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) because
that takes the maximum space. Before that let me go through some of the smallar Mac apps
I like.

## Emoji app

[Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) is a free Mac app that lets you type emojis slack style.
Download the app. Install it. Open it.

Now open Apple notes. Type I love `:hear` and you will see heart emoji.
Now open google doc and do the same. Do the same in google sheet.

Point is once this app is installed then you can type emojis really fast Slack style. This is so good that
it should be the default feature of Mac and Apple should ship it out of the box.

## Menu Bar Calendar

Sometimes in the call I need to discuss schedule and I need to share a calendar.
Typically I open google calendar but it has information about my upcoming meetings
and appointments.

[Menu Bar Calendar](https://sindresorhus.com/menu-bar-calendar) is a small calendar
which sits on the menu bar.
