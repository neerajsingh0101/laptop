# Introduction

A simple dotfile that gives sensible defaults, is fast and looks beautiful out of the box.

# Installation

```
mkdir -p ~/code/devkit
cd ~/code/devkit
git clone https://github.com/neerajsingh0101/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

* Before executing the next command, please note that the next command will back up your existing `~/.zshrc` file as `.zshrc-bkp-YYYYMMDDSSSS`. So
  If you don't want to use the dotfiles, you can revert to the backed-up `.zshrc` file.
* Execute `./bin/install`.
* You can run `./bin/install` any number of times.

# Wezterm as the terminal emulator
* Open [wezterm](https://wezterm.org/) instead of opening terminal or iterm application. Some of you might be using [ghostyy](https://ghostty.org/) or [warp](https://www.warp.dev/). Still I'll say that you should give wezterm a try for a few days.
* Shift + Ctrl governs wezterm configuration.
* Shift + Ctrl + i -> split in two left hand side and right hand side
* Shift + Ctrl + u -> split in two top side and bottom side
* Shift + Ctrl + h -> navigate to left pane
* Shift + Ctrl + l -> navigate to right pane
* Shift + Ctrl + j -> navigate to the bottom pane
* Shift + Ctrl + k -> navigate to the top pane
* Shift + Ctrl + w -> Quit the pane
* Shift + Ctrl + up arrow -> resize the pane and move up
* Shift + Ctrl + down arrow -> resize the pane and move down
* Shift + Ctrl + left arrow -> resize the pane and move left
* Shift + Ctrl + right arrow -> resize the pane and move right
* By default the tab name is the name of the running process. Press Shift + Ctrl + r to rename the tab.

# z command
`z` is a smarter `cd` command. It comes from [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide).

# sysinfo
* `sysinfo` lists info about your laptop.

# Override with dotfiles.local
This `zshrc` file loads `~/.dotfiles.local` if it exists. Use this file for private information like environment variables that shouldn't be committed to the repo.

# Mac defaults

Have a look at `bin/customize-macos`. I don't like every time Mac boots it makes a sound. So I've disabled it.
Similarly I don't like warning when I'm emptying trash.
